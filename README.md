	Doubly Linked List In C++

This is a doubly linked list program in C++.
Each Node will have a reference pointer to its next as well as previous node.

It maintains an ascending order.
So new elements are inserted in the right place.

Reversing A Linked List will reverse the list as well as the property
Ascending becomes descending and vice-versa.
So Order of various Process :

Insertion  : O(n)
Deletion   : O(n)
Reversal   : O(n)
Search     : O(n)
